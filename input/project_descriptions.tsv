Oxyfunctionalization of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by filamentous-fungi. 	Proteome analysis of B. bassiana	Beauveria bassiana, NSAIDs, P450s	AIMS: We aimed to expand the microbial biocatalyst platform to generate essential oxyfunctionalized standards for pharmaceutical, toxicological and environmental research. In particular, we examined the production of oxyfunctionalized nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by filamentous-fungi. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four NSAIDs; diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen and mefenamic acid were used as substrates for oxyfunctionalization in a biocatalytic process involving three filamentous-fungi strains; Beauveria bassiana, Clitocybe nebularis and Mucor hiemalis. Oxyfunctionalized metabolites that are major degradation intermediates formed by Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in human metabolism were produced in isolated yields of up to 99% using 1 g l(-1) of substrate. In addition, a novel compound, 3',4'-dihydroxydiclofenac, was produced by B. bassiana. Proteomic analysis identified CYP548A5 that might be responsible for diclofenac oxyfunctionalization in B. bassiana. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient fungi catalysed oxyfunctionalization was achieved when using NSAIDs as substrates. High purities and isolated yields of the produced metabolites were achieved. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The lack of current efficient synthetic strategies for oxyfunctionalization of NSAIDs is a bottleneck to perform pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicological analysis for the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, oxyfunctionalized derivatives are needed for tracking the fate and impact of such metabolites in the environment. Herein, we described a fungi catalysed process that surpasses previously reported strategies in terms of efficiency, to synthesize oxyfunctionalized NSAIDs.
The intrinsic and regulated proteomes of barley seeds in response to fungal infection. 	Targeted protomics of seeds of healthy and diseased barley	SWAT-MS	Barley is an important cereal grain used for beer brewing, animal feed, and human food consumption. Fungal disease can impact barley production, as it causes substantial yield loss and lowers seed quality. We used sequential window acquisition of all theoretical ions mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) to measure and quantify the relative abundance of proteins within seeds of different barley varieties under various fungal pathogen burdens (ProteomeXchange Datasets PXD011303 and PXD014093). Fungal burden in the leaves and stems of barley resulted in changes to the seed proteome. However, these changes were minimal and showed substantial variation among barley samples infected with different pathogens. The limited effect of intrinsic disease resistance on the seed proteome is consistent with the main mediators of disease resistance being present in the leaves and stems of the plant. The seeds of barley varieties accredited for use as malt had higher levels of proteins associated with starch synthesis and beer quality. The proteomic workflows developed and implemented here have potential application in quality control, breeding and processing of barley, and other agricultural products.
Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis reveals a diversity of venom-related and toxin-like peptides expressed in the mat anemone Zoanthus natalensis (Cnidaria, Hexacorallia). 	coral proteomics study	coral, transcriptomics	Venoms from marine animals have been recognized as a new emerging source of peptide-based therapeutics. Several peptide toxins from sea anemone have been investigated as therapeutic leads or pharmacological tools. Venom complexity should be further highlighted using combined strategies of large-scale sequencing and data analysis which integrated transcriptomics and proteomics to elucidate new proteins or peptides to be compared among species. In this work, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were combined to identify six groups of expressed peptide toxins in Zoanthus natalensis. These include neurotoxin, hemostatic and hemorrhagic toxin, protease inhibitor, mixed function enzymes, venom auxiliary proteins, allergen peptides, and peptides related to the innate immunity. Molecular docking analysis indicated that one expressed Zoanthus Kunitz-like peptide, ZoaKuz1, could be a voltage-gated potassium channels blocker and, hence, it was selected for functional studies. Functional bioassays revealed that ZoaKuz1 has an intrinsic neuroprotective activity in zebrafish model of Parkinson's disease. Since pharmacological blockade of KV channels is known to induce neuroprotective effects, ZoaKuz1 holds the potential to be developed in a therapeutic tool to control neural dysfunction by slowing or even halting neurodegeneration mediated by ion-channel hyperactivity.
Quantitative Proteomic Approach Identifies Vpr Binding Protein as Novel Host Factor Supporting Influenza A Virus Infections in Human Cells. 	Quantitative proteomic approach identifies Vpr binding protein as novel host factor supporting influenza A virus infections in human cells	Influenza, Vprbp, quantitative proteomics	Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a major cause for respiratory disease in humans, which affects all age groups and contributes substantially to global morbidity and mortality. IAV have a large natural host reservoir in avian species. However, many avian IAV strains lack adaptation to other hosts and hardly propagate in humans. While seasonal or pandemic IAV strains replicate efficiently in permissive human cells, many avian IAV cause abortive nonproductive infections in these hosts despite successful cell entry. However, the precise reasons for these differential outcomes are poorly defined. We hypothesized that the distinct course of an IAV infection with a given virus strain is determined by the differential interplay between specific host and viral factors. By using Spike-in SILAC mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics we characterized sets of cellular factors whose abundance is specifically up- or downregulated in the course of permissive versus nonpermissive IAV infection, respectively. This approach allowed for the definition and quantitative comparison of about 3500 proteins in human lung epithelial cells in response to seasonal or low-pathogenic avian H3N2 IAV. Many identified proteins were similarly regulated by both virus strains, but also 16 candidates with distinct changes in permissive versus nonpermissive infection were found. RNAi-mediated knockdown of these differentially regulated host factors identified Vpr binding protein (VprBP) as proviral host factor because its downregulation inhibited efficient propagation of seasonal IAV whereas overexpression increased viral replication of both seasonal and avian IAV. These results not only show that there are similar differences in the overall changes during permissive and nonpermissive influenza virus infections, but also provide a basis to evaluate VprBP as novel anti-IAV drug target.
Phosphoproteomics Reveals HMGA1, a CK2 Substrate, as a Drug-Resistant Target in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. 	Phosphopattern Predicts CK2 Substrate, HMGA1, as a Drug Resistant Target for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	CK2, Drug resistance, HMGA1, IMAC, lung cancer, phosphoproteome	Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have demonstrated good efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR mutations, most patients develop intrinsic and acquired resistance. We quantitatively profiled the phosphoproteome and proteome of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant NSCLC cells under gefitinib treatment. The construction of a dose-dependent responsive kinase-substrate network of 1548 phosphoproteins and 3834 proteins revealed CK2-centric modules as the dominant core network for the potential gefitinib resistance-associated proteins. CK2 knockdown decreased cell survival in gefitinib-resistant NSCLCs. Using motif analysis to identify the CK2 core sub-network, we verified that elevated phosphorylation level of a CK2 substrate, HMGA1 was a critical node contributing to EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC cell. Both HMGA1 knockdown or mutation of the CK2 phosphorylation site, S102, of HMGA1 reinforced the efficacy of gefitinib in resistant NSCLC cells through reactivation of the downstream signaling of EGFR. Our results delineate the TKI resistance-associated kinase-substrate network, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for overcoming TKI-induced resistance in NSCLC.
Global Proteomic Analysis of Lysine Malonylation in Toxoplasma gondii. 	First Global Proteomic Analysis of Lysine Malonylation in Toxoplasma gondii	Post-translational, Toxoplasma gondii, lysine malonylation, malonylome, modifications	Lysine malonylation (Kmal) is a new post-translational modification (PTM), which has been reported in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. Although Kmal can regulate many and diverse biological processes in various organisms, knowledge about this important PTM in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is limited. In this study, we performed the first global profiling of malonylated proteins in T. gondii tachyzoites using affinity enrichment and Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Three experiments performed in tandem revealed 294, 345, 352 Kmal sites on 203, 236, 230 malonylated proteins, respectively. Computational analysis showed the identified malonylated proteins to be localized in various subcellular compartments and involved in many cellular functions, particularly mitochondrial function. Additionally, one conserved Kmal motif with a strong bias for cysteine was detected. Taken together, these findings provide the first report of Kmal profile in T. gondii and should be an important resource for studying the physiological roles of Kmal in this parasite.
EDEM1 Drives Misfolded Protein Degradation via ERAD and Exploits ER-Phagy as Back-Up Mechanism When ERAD Is Impaired. 	EDEM1 interaction proteomics in HEK293T cells	EDEM1, ER-phagy, ERAD, LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro, proteasomal degradation	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is the main mechanism of targeting ER proteins for degradation to maintain homeostasis, and perturbations of ERAD lead to pathological conditions. ER-degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like (EDEM1) was proposed to extract terminally misfolded proteins from the calnexin folding cycle and target them for degradation by ERAD. Here, using mass-spectrometry and biochemical methods, we show that EDEM1 is found in auto-regulatory complexes with ERAD components. Moreover, the N-terminal disordered region of EDEM1 mediates protein-protein interaction with misfolded proteins, whilst the absence of this domain significantly impairs their degradation. We also determined that overexpression of EDEM1 can induce degradation, even when proteasomal activity is severely impaired, by promoting the formation of aggregates, which can be further degraded by autophagy. Therefore, we propose that EDEM1 maintains ER homeostasis and mediates ERAD client degradation via autophagy when either dislocation or proteasomal degradation are impaired.
Cdh1-APC Regulates Protein Synthesis and Stress Granules in Neurons through an FMRP-Dependent Mechanism. 	Cdh1 (Fzr1) Interactome in Neuroblastoma (N2A) cells	Cdh1, Fzr1, Protein Synthesis, Ubiquitination	Maintaining a balance between protein degradation and protein synthesis is necessary for neurodevelopment. Although the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex and its regulatory subunit Cdh1 (Cdh1-APC) has been shown to regulate learning and memory, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we have identified a role of Cdh1-APC as a regulator of protein synthesis in neurons. Proteomic profiling revealed that Cdh1-APC interacts with known regulators of translation, including stress granule proteins. Inhibition of Cdh1-APC activity caused an increase in stress granule formation that is dependent on fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We propose a model in which Cdh1-APC targets stress granule proteins, such as FMRP, and inhibits the formation of stress granules, leading to protein synthesis. Elucidation of a role for Cdh1-APC in regulation of stress granules and protein synthesis in neurons has implications for how Cdh1-APC can regulate protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory.
Global Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals Significant Metabolic Reprogramming in the Termination of Liver Regeneration in Mice. 	Global Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals Significant Metabolic Reprogramming in the Termination of Liver Regeneration in Mice	Phosphorylation, liver regeneration, metabolic reprogramming, partial hepatectomy	Phosphorylation is crucial in regulating various biological processes. However, comprehensive phosphoproteomic profiling in the termination of liver regeneration (LR) is still missing. Here, we used Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling coupled with phosphopeptide enrichment and two-dimensional (2D) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS analysis to establish a global phosphoproteomic map in the liver of mice at day 5 after partial hepatectomy (PH). Altogether, 9731 phosphosites from 3443 proteins were identified and 7802 phosphosites from 2980 proteins were quantified. Motif analysis of the identified phosphosites revealed a diverse array of consensus sequences, suggesting that multiple kinase families including ERK/MAPK, PKA/PKC, CaMK-II, CKII, and CDK may be involved in the termination of LR. Functional clustering analysis of proteins with dysregulated phosphosites showed that they mainly participate in metabolic pathways, DNA replication, and tight junction. More importantly, the deletion of PP2Acalpha in the liver remarkably changes the overall phosphorylation profile, indicating its critical role in regulating the termination of LR. Finally, several differentially phosphorylated sites were validated by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Taken together, our data unravel the first comprehensive phosphoproteomic map in the termination of LR in mice, which greatly expands our knowledge in the complicated regulation of this process and provides new directions for the treatment of liver cancer using liver resection.
Subcellular proteomics combined with bioenergetic phenotyping reveals protein biomarkers of respiratory insufficiency in the setting of proofreading-deficient mitochondrial polymerase. 	Subcellular proteomics combined with bioenergetic phenotyping reveals protein biomarkers of respiratory insufficiency in the setting of compromised mitochondrial DNA repair.	DNA polymerase gamma, Mitochondrial proteome, TMT6plex, heart, mitochondrial DNA, skeletal muscle	The mitochondrial mutator mouse is a well-established model of premature aging. In addition to accelerated aging, these mice develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at ~13 months of age, presumably due to overt mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite evidence of bioenergetic disruption within heart mitochondria, there is little information about the underlying changes to the mitochondrial proteome that either directly underly or predict respiratory insufficiency in mutator mice. Herein, nLC-MS/MS was used to interrogate the mitochondria-enriched proteome of heart and skeletal muscle of aged mutator mice. The mitochondrial proteome from heart tissue was then correlated with respiratory conductance data to identify protein biomarkers of respiratory insufficiency. The majority of downregulated proteins in mutator mitochondria were subunits of respiratory complexes I and IV, including both nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Interestingly, the mitochondrial-encoded complex V subunits, were unchanged or upregulated in mutator mitochondria, suggesting a robustness to mtDNA mutation. Finally, the proteins most strongly correlated with respiratory conductance were PPM1K, NDUFB11, and C15orf61. These results suggest that mitochondrial mutator mice undergo a specific loss of mitochondrial complexes I and IV that limit their respiratory function independent of an upregulation of complex V. Additionally, the role of PPM1K in responding to mitochondrial stress warrants further exploration.
Comparative proteomic analysis of the brain and colon in three rat models of irritable bowel syndrome. 	Comparative proteomic analysis of the brain and colon in three rat models of irritable bowel syndrome	brain, colon, irritable bowel syndrome models	BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been gradually recognized as a disorder of the brain-gut interaction, but the molecular changes in the brain and colon that occur in disease development remain poorly understood. We employed proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in both the brain and colon of three IBS models. METHODS: To explore the relevant protein abundance changes in the brain and colon, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and Western blotting methods were used in three IBS models, including maternal separation (MS, group B), chronic wrap restraint stress (CWRS, group C) and a combination of MS and CWRS (group D). RESULTS: We identified 153, 280, and 239 proteins that were common and differentially expressed in the two tissue types of groups B, C and D, respectively; 43 differentially expressed proteins showed the same expression changes among the three groups, including 25 proteins upregulated in the colon and downregulated in the brain, 7 proteins downregulated in the colon and upregulated in the brain, and 3 proteins upregulated and 8 downregulated in both tissues. Gene ontology analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with cellular assembly and organization and cellular function and maintenance. Protein interaction network and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that the differentiated proteins were mainly involved in the protein ubiquitination pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data presented represent a comprehensive and quantitative proteomic analysis of the brain and colon in IBS models, providing new evidence of an abnormal brain-gut interaction in IBS. These data may be useful for further investigation of potential targets in the diagnosis and treatment of IBS.
Reciprocal transplantation of the heterotrophic coral Tubastraea coccinea (Scleractinia: Dendrophylliidae) between distinct habitats did not alter its venom toxin composition. 	Reciprocal transplantation of the coral Tubastraea coccinea	Sun Coral Transplantation	Tubastraea coccinea is an azooxanthellate coral species recorded in the Indian and Atlantic oceans and is presently widespread in the southwestern Atlantic with an alien status for Brazil. T. coccinea outcompete other native coral species by using a varied repertoire of biological traits. For example, T. coccinea has evolved potent venom capable of immobilizing and digesting zooplankton prey. Diversification and modification of venom toxins can provide potential adaptive benefits to individual fitness, yet acquired alteration of venom composition in cnidarians is poorly understood as the adaptive flexibility affecting toxin composition in these ancient lineages has been largely ignored. We used quantitative high-throughput proteomics to detect changes in toxin expression in clonal fragments of specimens collected and interchanged from two environmentally distinct and geographically separate study sites. Unexpectedly, despite global changes in protein expression, there were no changes in the composition and abundance of toxins from coral fragments recovered from either site, and following clonal transplantation between sites. There were also no apparent changes to the cnidome (cnidae) and gross skeletal or soft tissue morphologies of the specimens. These results suggest that the conserved toxin complexity of T. coccinea co-evolved with innovation of the venom delivery system, and its morphological development and phenotypic expression are not modulated by habitat pressures over short periods of time. The adaptive response of the venom trait to specific predatory regimes, however, necessitates further consideration.
The quantitative and condition-dependent Escherichia coli proteome. 	The quantitative and condition-dependent Escherichia coli proteome	Absolute quantiifcation, E. coli, iBAQ, mass spectreomtry	Measuring precise concentrations of proteins can provide insights into biological processes. Here we use efficient protein extraction and sample fractionation, as well as state-of-the-art quantitative mass spectrometry techniques to generate a comprehensive, condition-dependent protein-abundance map for Escherichia coli. We measure cellular protein concentrations for 55% of predicted E. coli genes (>2,300 proteins) under 22 different experimental conditions and identify methylation and N-terminal protein acetylations previously not known to be prevalent in bacteria. We uncover system-wide proteome allocation, expression regulation and post-translational adaptations. These data provide a valuable resource for the systems biology and broader E. coli research communities.
Hair-bundle proteomes of avian and mammalian inner-ear utricles. 	Reprocessed: Chick utricle hair bundles and utricular epitheliumâ€”Orbitrap	Hair cells, stereocilia, utricle, vestibular	Examination of multiple proteomics datasets within or between species increases the reliability of protein identification. We report here proteomes of inner-ear hair bundles from three species (chick, mouse, and rat), which were collected on LTQ or LTQ Velos ion-trap mass spectrometers; the constituent proteins were quantified using MS2 intensities, which are the summed intensities of all peptide fragmentation spectra matched to a protein. The data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD002410 (chick LTQ), PXD002414 (chick Velos), PXD002415 (mouse Velos), and PXD002416 (rat LTQ). The two chick bundle datasets compared favourably to a third, already-described chick bundle dataset, which was quantified using MS1 peak intensities, the summed intensities of peptides identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry (PXD000104; updated analysis in PXD002445). The mouse bundle dataset described here was comparable to a different mouse bundle dataset quantified using MS1 intensities (PXD002167). These six datasets will be useful for identifying the core proteome of vestibular hair bundles.
Proteomic Analysis of Drug-Resistant Mycobacteria: Co-Evolution of Copper and INH Resistance. 	Proteomic Analysis of Drug-resistant Mycobacteria	copper resistant, drug resistant, mycobacteria	Tuberculosis, caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a worldwide public health threat. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is capable of resisting various stresses in host cells, including high levels of ROS and copper ions. To better understand the resistance mechanisms of mycobacteria to copper, we generated a copper-resistant strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis, mc2155-Cu from the selection of copper sulfate treated-bacteria. The mc2155-Cu strain has a 5-fold higher resistance to copper sulfate and a 2-fold higher resistance to isoniazid (INH) than its parental strain mc2155, respectively. Quantitative proteomics was carried out to find differentially expressed proteins between mc2155 and mc2155-Cu. Among 345 differentially expressed proteins, copper-translocating P-type ATPase was up-regulated, while all other ABC transporters were down-regulated in mc2155-Cu, suggesting copper-translocating P-type ATPase plays a crucial role in copper resistance. Results also indicated that the down-regulation of metabolic enzymes and decreases in cellular NAD, FAD, mycothiol, and glutamine levels in mc2155-Cu were responsible for its slowing growth rate as compared to mc2155. Down-regulation of KatG2 expression in both protein and mRNA levels indicates the co-evolution of copper and INH resistance in copper resistance bacteria, and provides new evidence to understanding of the molecular mechanisms of survival of mycobacteria under stress conditions.
Photoperiod affects the cerebrospinal fluid proteome: a comparison between short day- and long day-treated ewes. 	Comparative proteomics of the ewe cerebrospinal fluid under long or short photoperiod	Cerebrospinal fluid	Photoperiod is the main physical synchronizer of seasonal functions and a key factor in the modulation of molecule access to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in animals. Previous work has shown that photoperiod affects the transfer rate of steroids and protein hormones from blood to CSF and modulates choroid plexus tight junction protein content. We hypothesized that the CSF proteome would also be modified by photoperiod. We tested this hypothesis by comparing CSF obtained from the third ventricle of mature, ovariectomized, estradiol-replaced ewes exposed to long day length (LD) or short day length (SD). Variations in CSF protein expression between SD- or LD-treated ewes were studied in pools of CSF collected for 48 h. Proteins were precipitated, concentrated, and included in a polyacrylamide gel without protein fractionation. After in-gel tryptic digestion of total protein samples, we analyzed the resulting peptides by nanoliquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). Quantitative analysis was performed using 2 methods based on spectral counting and extracted ion chromatograms. Among 103 identified proteins, 41 were differentially expressed between LD and SD ewes (with P < 0.05 and at least a 1.5-fold difference). Of the 41 differentially expressed proteins, 22 were identified by both methods and 19 using extracted ion chromatograms only. Eighteen proteins were more abundant in LD ewes and 23 were more abundant in SD ewes. These proteins are involved in numerous functions including hormone transport, immune system activity, metabolism, and angiogenesis. To confirm proteomic results, 2 proteins, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and gelsolin, for each individual sample of CSF collected under SD or LD were analyzed with Western blots. These results suggest an important photoperiod-dependent change in CSF proteome composition. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to assess the role of each protein in seasonal functions.
iTRAQ-facilitated proteomic profiling of anthers from a photosensitive male sterile mutant and wild-type cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). 	iTRAQ-Facilitated Proteomic Profiling of Cotton Anthers	Anther, Cotton, iTRAQ	Male sterility is a common phenomenon in flowering plants, and it has been successfully developed in several crops by taking advantage of heterosis. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important economic crop, used mainly for the production of textile fiber. Using a space mutation breeding technique, a novel photosensitive genetic male sterile mutant CCRI9106 was isolated from the wild-type upland cotton cultivar CCRI040029. To use CCRI9106 in cotton hybrid breeding, it is of great importance to study the molecular mechanisms of its male sterility. Here, histological and iTRAQ-facilitated proteomic analyses of anthers were performed to explore male sterility mechanisms of the mutant. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the anthers showed that the development of pollen wall in CCRI9106 was severely defective with a lack of exine formation. At the protein level, 6121 high-confidence proteins were identified and 325 of them showed differential expression patterns between mutant and wild-type anthers. The proteins up- or down-regulated in MT anthers were mainly involved in exine formation, protein degradation, calcium ion binding,etc. These findings provide valuable information on the proteins involved in anther and pollen development, and contribute to elucidate the mechanism of male sterility in upland cotton.
Global Phosphoproteomic Mapping of Early Mitotic Exit in Human Cells Identifies Novel Substrate Dephosphorylation Motifs. 	Global phosphoproteomic mapping of early mitotic exit in human cells identifies novel substrate dephosphorylation motifs	MYC, Mitosis, PRC1, SILAC, kinase, mitotic exit, motif, phosphatase, phosphoproteomics, phosphorylation, spindle assembly checkpoint.	Entry into mitosis is driven by the coordinated phosphorylation of thousands of proteins. For the cell to complete mitosis and divide into two identical daughter cells it must regulate dephosphorylation of these proteins in a highly ordered, temporal manner. There is currently a lack of a complete understanding of the phosphorylation changes that occur during the initial stages of mitotic exit in human cells. Therefore, we performed a large unbiased, global analysis to map the very first dephosphorylation events that occur as cells exit mitosis. We identified and quantified the modification of >16,000 phosphosites on >3300 unique proteins during early mitotic exit, providing up to eightfold greater resolution than previous studies. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001559. Only a small fraction (~ 10%) of phosphorylation sites were dephosphorylated during early mitotic exit and these occurred on proteins involved in critical early exit events, including organization of the mitotic spindle, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and reformation of the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly this enrichment was observed across all kinase consensus motifs, indicating that it is independent of the upstream phosphorylating kinase. Therefore, dephosphorylation of these sites is likely determined by the specificity of phosphatase/s rather than the activity of kinase/s. Dephosphorylation was significantly affected by the amino acids at and surrounding the phosphorylation site, with several unique evolutionarily conserved amino acids correlating strongly with phosphorylation status. These data provide a potential mechanism for the specificity of phosphatases, and how they co-ordinate the ordered events of mitotic exit. In summary, our results provide a global overview of the phosphorylation changes that occur during the very first stages of mitotic exit, providing novel mechanistic insight into how phosphatase/s specifically regulate this critical transition.
Proteomic analysis of the Cyanophora paradoxa muroplast provides clues on early events in plastid endosymbiosis. 	Cyanophora paradoxa muroplast LC-MSMS	Cyanophora, Glaucophyte, plastid	Glaucophytes represent the first lineage of photosynthetic eukaryotes of primary endosymbiotic origin that diverged after plastid establishment. The muroplast of Cyanophora paradoxa represents a primitive plastid that resembles its cyanobacterial ancestor in pigment composition and the presence of a peptidoglycan wall. To attain insights into the evolutionary history of cyanobiont integration and plastid development, it would thus be highly desirable to obtain knowledge on the composition of the glaucophyte plastid proteome. Here, we provide the first proteomic analysis of the muroplast of C. paradoxa. Mass spectrometric analysis of the muroplast proteome identified 510 proteins with high confidence. The protein repertoire of the muroplast revealed novel paths for reduced carbon flow and export to the cytosol through a sugar phosphate transporter of chlamydial origin. We propose that C. paradoxa possesses a primordial plastid mirroring the situation in the early protoalga.
Global Proteome Analyses of Lysine Acetylation and Succinylation Reveal the Widespread Involvement of both Modification in Metabolism in the Embryo of Germinating Rice Seed. 	Succinylome analyses in the germinating rice seed	Succinylome, rice, seed germination	Regulation of rice seed germination has been shown to mainly occur at post-transcriptional levels, of which the changes on proteome status is a major one. Lysine acetylation and succinylation are two prevalent protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) involved in multiple biological processes, especially for metabolism regulation. To investigate the potential mechanism controlling metabolism regulation in rice seed germination, we performed the lysine acetylation and succinylation analyses simultaneously. Using high-accuracy nano-LC-MS/MS in combination with the enrichment of lysine acetylated or succinylated peptides from digested embryonic proteins of 24 h after imbibition (HAI) rice seed, a total of 699 acetylated sites from 389 proteins and 665 succinylated sites from 261 proteins were identified. Among these modified lysine sites, 133 sites on 78 proteins were commonly modified by two PTMs. The overlapped PTM sites were more likely to be in polar acidic/basic amino acid regions and exposed on the protein surface. Both of the acetylated and succinylated proteins cover nearly all aspects of cellular functions. Ribosome complex and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis-related proteins were significantly enriched in both acetylated and succinylated protein profiles through KEGG enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses. The acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA metabolism-related enzymes were found to be extensively modified by both modifications, implying the functional interaction between the two PTMs. This study provides a rich resource to examine the modulation of the two PTMs on the metabolism pathway and other biological processes in germinating rice seed.
